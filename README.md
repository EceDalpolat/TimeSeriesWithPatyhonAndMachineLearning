# TimeSeriesWithPatyhonAndMachineLearning
# Time Series Analysis and Modeling

This repository contains my work on time series analysis, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques.

## Overview

This project aims to explore and model time series data to extract insights and make future predictions. It includes:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS)
- Seasonal decomposition
- Autoregressive models (ARIMA, SARIMA, etc.)
- Machine learning models for time series (XGBoost, LSTM, etc.)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally and start experimenting with the code.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, etc.

Install the required libraries using the following command:
